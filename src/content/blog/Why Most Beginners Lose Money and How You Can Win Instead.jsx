            Why Do Most Beginners Lose Money? The Hidden Truths
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Understanding the root causes of losses is essential if you want to
            break the cycle. Let’s take a deep dive into the primary reasons
            beginners struggle and lose money:
          </p>

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
                1. Insufficient Knowledge and Lack of Preparation
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Many beginners treat investing like gambling, jumping in without
                learning the basics. They rely on hearsay, “hot stock tips,” or
                emotional impulses rather than solid research.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>The danger:</strong> Without understanding market
                mechanics, valuation, or risk, you’re flying blind.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>How to avoid:</strong> Commit to ongoing education
                through books, online courses, financial news, and mentorship
                before risking real capital.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
                2. Emotional Bias — Fear and Greed
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                The biggest enemies of beginner investors are{" "}
                <strong>emotions</strong>. Fear causes panic selling during
                dips, while greed pushes you to chase “too good to be true”
                opportunities.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Real example:</strong> During the 2020 pandemic crash,
                many investors sold at lows out of fear, locking in losses,
                while savvy investors bought quality assets at discounted
                prices.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Developing emotional discipline is
                crucial — learn to stay calm and stick to your plan during
                market turbulence.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
                3. Lack of Risk Management and Overexposure
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Beginners often ignore the fundamentals of risk management. They
                invest too much in one trade or use excessive leverage, which
                magnifies losses.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> Use stop-loss orders, diversify your
                portfolio, and never risk more than 1-2% of your capital on a
                single trade.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
                4. Unrealistic Expectations and Impatience
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Expecting to become a millionaire overnight sets you up for
                disappointment. Impatience often leads beginners to deviate from
                their strategy or chase “quick wins.”
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Truth:</strong> Wealth-building is a marathon, not a
                sprint. Consistency over time produces better results than
                chasing hype.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
                5. Following the Crowd Without Question
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                The herd mentality can be deadly. Popular trends and viral
                investment fads often inflate asset prices beyond their real
                value.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Example:</strong> The cryptocurrency bubble of 2017 saw
                many beginners jump in at the peak, only to face steep losses
                afterward.

              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">Your plan should include:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-2">
                <li>
                  Clear goals (short-term trading vs. long-term investing)

                <strong>Example:</strong> Decide beforehand that you won’t risk

                stop-loss orders to limit losses.

                <li>
