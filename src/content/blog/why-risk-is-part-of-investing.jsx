            When people think about investing, they often focus on the potential
            gains—growing wealth, building a retirement fund, or achieving
            financial independence. But what many overlook is the{" "}
            <strong>inescapable companion of investing: risk</strong>. Risk is
            not just a side effect of investing—it’s a fundamental part of it.
            Understanding risk, accepting it, and learning how to manage it
            effectively is essential for any investor, whether you're just
            starting out or have decades of experience.

            What Is Investment Risk?
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            Investment risk refers to the{" "}
            <strong>uncertainty in expected returns</strong> on an
            investment—including the possibility of losing part or all of the
            original investment. Unlike a savings account, where your money
            grows slowly but steadily, investing exposes your money to market
            forces, economic changes, political instability, interest rate
            shifts, and business performance.

                1. Higher Returns Require Higher Risk
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                There is a direct relationship between{" "}
                <strong>investment risk and potential return</strong>.
                Generally, to earn higher returns, you must be willing to accept
                more risk. This is known as the{" "}
                <strong>risk-return tradeoff</strong>.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Example</strong>: Consider Rahul, a 30-year-old who
                decides to invest ₹10,00,000 in a diversified equity mutual
                fund. Over 10 years, his portfolio grows at an average of 12%
                annually. However, during this period, he sees years where
                returns are -10%, +20%, +5%, and even -15%. Despite the
                fluctuations, his patience and understanding of long-term risk
                allowed him to benefit from compounding.
              </p>

                2. The Economy is Unpredictable
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Global events like recessions, pandemics (e.g., COVID-19), and
                wars can shake even the most stable markets. Investors can't
                predict these events, but they can plan for them. Risk arises
                from the very nature of the world we live in—it’s unpredictable.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Example</strong>: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the
                stock market initially plummeted. Many investors panicked and
                sold their assets at a loss. Others stayed invested or even
                bought more during the dip. A year later, markets rebounded, and
                those who remained calm often saw significant gains.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Despite these risks, investing remains a fundamental method for
                building wealth over time. The key lies in managing these risks
                effectively.

            5 Smart Ways to Manage Investment Risk
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            While risk can't be eliminated, it{" "}
            <strong>can be managed strategically</strong>. Here’s how:

          <div className="space-y-6">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
                1. Diversification
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Diversification involves spreading investments across different{" "}
                <strong>asset classes, sectors</strong>, and{" "}
                <strong>regions</strong> to reduce overall risk. Don’t put all
                eggs in one basket. The idea is that when one asset
                underperforms, others may perform well, balancing the outcome.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Example</strong>: An investor might allocate their
                portfolio as follows:
              </p>

                2. Asset Allocation
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Asset allocation refers to the strategic distribution of
                investments among different asset categories based on an
                individual's risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.
                A well-thought-out asset allocation plan aligns with one's
                financial objectives and risk appetite.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Here's a simplified guide to asset allocation based on risk
                appetite:

              <Table columns={columns3} data={data3} />

              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Example</strong>: A young investor with a high-risk
                tolerance might have a portfolio with 80% equities and 20%
                bonds, aiming for higher growth. Conversely, an investor nearing
                retirement may prefer a 40% equities and 60% bonds allocation to
                preserve capital.

                3. Invest via SIPs (Rupee Cost Averaging)
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Investing small amounts regularly through SIPs helps smooth out
                market volatility and encourages disciplined investing.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Example</strong>: Vikram invests ₹5,000 per month via
                SIP in a mutual fund. Over 15 years, he contributes ₹9,00,000 in
                total. Thanks to rupee cost averaging and compounding, his
                investment grows to over ₹20,00,000—despite market ups and
                downs.

                4. Emergency Fund
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Having 3–6 months’ worth of expenses in a{" "}
                <strong>liquid savings account</strong> or short-term debt fund
                prevents you from tapping into long-term investments during
                emergencies.

                5. Review and Rebalance Regularly
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Over time, market fluctuations can cause a portfolio's asset
                allocation to drift from its original plan. Regular rebalancing
                involves adjusting the portfolio back to its target allocation,
                ensuring it remains aligned with the investor's goals and risk
                tolerance.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Example</strong>: If your original plan was 60% equity
                and 40% bonds, and equity has grown to 75%, rebalancing brings
                it back to 60% by moving profits into bonds.

            Conclusion: Risk Isn’t the Enemy—Ignorance Is
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Understanding and managing investment risk is not about avoiding
            risk altogether—it's about being smart with it. Think of risk as the
            toll you pay on the highway to wealth creation. The toll might seem
            costly in the short term, especially during market crashes, but
            avoiding the highway altogether usually means you'll never reach
            your destination.
