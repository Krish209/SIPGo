            The Side Hustle Phenomenon: What’s Driving the Shift?

            Economic Pressures Fueling the Side Hustle Boom
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            In 2025, the global economy remains volatile. Inflation rates have
            pushed up everyday costs—from rent and groceries to student loan
            repayments—forcing many young professionals to seek additional
            income streams. According to recent surveys, over 45% of millennials
            and Gen Z are currently engaged in at least one side hustle. This
            figure has grown dramatically compared to just five years ago,
            signaling a fundamental shift in how the younger workforce
            approaches money-making.

            The Appeal of Flexibility and Autonomy
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Young professionals value flexibility more than previous
            generations. The rise of remote work and digital platforms allows
            them to tailor their work schedules and locations. Side hustles
            offer an unmatched level of autonomy, letting individuals decide
            what projects to take on and when to work. This flexibility is
            particularly attractive to those balancing personal development,
            family, or further education.
