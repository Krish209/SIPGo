            <strong>million‑dollar (or ₹1 crore+) net worth</strong>—not because

              2000—turning ₹10 lakh into ~₹1.5 crore—and in the last decade

            <li>
              Indian SIP investors using the Nifty 50 Index or similar have seen
              10‑15% CAGR over multi‑year periods.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reddit posts cite the Nifty CAGR around 11.8%, though moving to a
              conservative 9% long-term expectation might be prudent.

              In the U.S., investing $10,000 in the S&P 500 in 2001 would reach

            <li>
              <strong>Live Below Your Means</strong>: Cutting lifestyle creep
              frees up funds for SIPs and wealth moves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automate Everything</strong>: Automate SIPs and savings to
              avoid manual missteps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Diversify Smartly</strong>: A simple multi-index
              portfolio—say U.S. + global + emerging small-cap/value—can beat
              single-index returns and reduce risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Minimize Fees</strong>: Low-cost index funds (0.2–0.5%
              expense ratio) retain more compounding power versus expensive
              active funds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build Resilience and Long‑Term Thinking</strong>: Index
              returns remain positive across bear markets when held over long
              durations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Avoid High‑Interest Debt</strong>: Eliminate consumer debt
              (especially if greater than 6% interest) to free capital for
              compounding.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Keep Learning</strong>: Reading, understanding fees, taxes
              (e.g. LTCG relief in India under ₹1.25 lakh), rebalancing—and
              sometimes tax‑efficient tools (IRAs, 401(k)s, ISAs).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add Side Income Streams</strong>: Extra freelancing,
              online income, or rental can let you increase SIPs and supercharge
              growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Allocate a Small Portion for Learning via Stocks</strong>:
              Experts like Rob Arnott suggest dedicating ~5% to direct stock
              exposure—not for returns, but to build investing skill and
              discipline.

              <strong>"I earn little—can I still do this?"</strong>
              <br />
              Yes. Even ₹50/day or $5/day correctly automated compounds
              significantly over decades.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"What about market crashes?"</strong>
              <br />
              When averaged over ≥7–10 years, indices historically yield
              positive returns; avoiding panic is key.

              <strong>"Active funds might give better returns?"</strong>
              <br />
              Although some long-term active funds outperform, most fail to beat
              index funds after fees—and 90% of active funds do worse over 20
              years.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Is 12% CAGR realistic in India?"</strong>
              <br />
              Historically yes—Sensex/Nifty compounding ~11‑14% CAGR; a
              conservative long-term estimate of 9–12% is well supported.

              <br />
