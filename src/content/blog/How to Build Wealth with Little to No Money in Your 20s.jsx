            Why Starting Early Matters: The Power of Time and Compound Interest
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            The earlier you start building wealth, the more time your money has
            to grow. Thanks to compound interest, even small investments can
            turn into significant assets over decades.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Albert Einstein reportedly called compound interest the "eighth
            wonder of the world."
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">For example:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              Investing $100 monthly from age 20, with an average 7% annual
              return, could grow to over $260,000 by age 65.
            </li>
            <li>
              Waiting until 30 to start investing the same amount results in
              roughly half that growth.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Key takeaway</strong>: Your 20s are your financial
            springboard — don’t wait to start!

            Step 1: Cultivate a Wealth Mindset That Fuels Success
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Wealth starts with your mindset. A wealth mindset means seeing
            opportunities rather than obstacles and believing you can improve
            your financial situation.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              Adopt long-term thinking: Wealth isn’t built overnight. Stay
              patient and persistent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid the scarcity trap: Instead of focusing on what you lack,
              focus on what you can do.
            </li>
            <li>
              Surround yourself with financially savvy people: Join communities,
              listen to podcasts, and read blogs focused on financial growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set SMART financial goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
              Relevant, and Time-bound goals keep you on track.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Journal your financial goals and review
            them monthly to reinforce your mindset.

            Step 2: Master Budgeting with Zero-Based and Envelope Methods
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            A budget is your blueprint for wealth. It’s not about restricting
            yourself but about directing your money intentionally.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              Zero-Based Budget: Assign every dollar a purpose, so income minus
              expenses equals zero.
            </li>
            <li>
              Envelope System: Use cash envelopes for spending categories to
              control overspending.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use free apps like Mint, YNAB (You Need A Budget), or Personal
              Capital to automate tracking.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Statistic</strong>: According to a study by the National
            Endowment for Financial Education, people who use budgets are 2.5

          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Unexpected expenses can derail wealth-building efforts. An emergency

          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            High-interest debt, especially credit card debt, can quickly

            <li>
              Alternatively, the Debt Snowball Method pays off smaller debts
              first to build momentum.
            </li>
            <li>
              Negotiate lower interest rates or consider balance transfers with
              0% introductory APRs.

            <li>Avoid taking on new debts during this phase.</li>

            <strong>Expert Insight</strong>: Financial advisor “Dave Ramsey
