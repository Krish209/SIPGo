            When it comes to investing, one golden rule always holds true —
            <strong>don’t put all your eggs in one basket</strong>. This age-old
            saying captures the essence of{" "}
            <strong>portfolio diversification</strong>. Whether you're a
            seasoned investor or just starting with mutual funds or stocks,
            diversifying your portfolio is key to reducing risk and improving
            long-term returns. In this post, we'll explore how to diversify your
            investment portfolio in India, with actionable strategies, real-life
            examples, and expert tips.

            What is Portfolio Diversification?
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Portfolio diversification</strong> means spreading your
            investments across various asset classes, sectors, and geographies
            to reduce risk. The idea is simple: different investments perform
            differently under the same economic conditions. When one asset
            underperforms, another might outperform, balancing the overall
            returns.

          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            Imagine you invest your entire savings in a single company’s stock.
            If that company performs poorly or faces a crisis, your entire
            investment could be at risk. However, if you had invested in
            multiple companies across sectors like IT, pharma, and FMCG, your
            losses in one area could be offset by gains in another.

                Each asset class reacts differently to economic events. Here's

                Instead of putting the entire amount into mutual funds, you
                could allocate ₹4,00,000 into equity mutual funds, ₹3,00,000

                delivered strong returns. Having some exposure to such markets
                would have balanced losses.

            <li>

              <strong>Ignoring Costs</strong>: High fees can eat into returns.
              Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs where possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Neglecting Risk Profile</strong>: Always align

            <li>
              <strong>Chasing Trends</strong>: Avoid jumping into hot sectors
