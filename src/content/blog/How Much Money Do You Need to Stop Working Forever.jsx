            Introduction: What Is Your FIRE Number?
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>How much money do you need to stop working forever?</strong>{" "}
            is one of the most searched questions in personal finance. Your{" "}
            <strong>FIRE number</strong>—or financial independence corpus—is the
            amount of savings and investments required to retire with
            confidence, sustainably funding your life without drawing from
            earned income. In this guide, we’ll walk through proven formulas,
            real-life case studies in both ₹ and USD, and actionable steps to
            get your number.

            1. Understanding the Core Rules: 25× or 30× Your Annual Expenses
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>The 4% Rule</strong>: Based on the Trinity Study, this rule
            suggests you can withdraw 4% of your retirement portfolio in the
            first year and adjust for inflation thereafter. This gives a 95–98%
            chance that your money will last for at least 30 years.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>25× Formula</strong>: Your corpus = Annual Expenses × 25.
            Ideal for retirement within traditional age ranges.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Conservative Approach</strong>: For early retirees planning
            40–60 years horizon, use 3.25–3.5% withdrawal rates, leading to
            25–30× multipliers.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            Example (USD):
          </h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-2">
            <li>$60k/year → Corpus:</li>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-2">
              <li>At 4% = $1.5M (× 25)</li>
              <li>At 3.5% = $1.71M (× 28)</li>
              <li>At 3.25% = $1.85M (× 30)</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">

            2. Deep Dive: Key Variables That Shape Your FIRE Number
          </h2>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-2 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Inflation & Real-Returns</strong>
              <br />
              India: inflation ~6–7% per year
              <br />
              US/global: ~2–3% per year
              <br />
              Make sure your FIRE corpus accounts for inflation and rising
              living costs over a 30–40-year retirement horizon.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Investment Returns</strong>
              <br />
              Pre-retirement: equity-heavy portfolios may earn 10–12%
              <br />
              Post-retirement: shift to conservative allocation (debt, bonds)
              yield ~8–10%
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Life Expectancy</strong>
              <br />
              Factor in longevity—if retiring at 55 and expecting to live until
              90, plan for at least 35 years of withdrawals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Special Expenses</strong>
              <br />
              Include one‑offs like children’s education, health emergencies,
              weddings, travel or family support. Add these into your “bucket
              hole” gap planning.

                A: The 4% rule says you can safely withdraw 4% of your initial
                retirement portfolio in year one (adjusted for inflation
                annually) and expect your savings to last ~30 years.

                A: For traditional retirement horizons (~30 years), 25× is
                considered safe. For early retirement or longer durations,
                consider 28–30× to buffer inflation and longevity.

                A: Multiply your planned annual spend by 25–30. E.g.

                A: Yes—income from pensions, rental property, dividends or

                capital, reducing your FIRE number.
