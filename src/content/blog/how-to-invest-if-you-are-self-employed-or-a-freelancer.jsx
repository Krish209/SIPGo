            Freelancing and self-employment in India have surged in recent
            years. Whether you’re a graphic designer, content writer, digital
            marketer, or independent consultant, managing your own financial
            planning is crucial. Unlike salaried employees, you don’t have the
            safety net of employer benefits like EPF, gratuity, or health
            insurance—making smart investment decisions vital for your financial
            security.

            Being self-employed gives you flexibility, but it also comes with

          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">

              Irregular income can make it difficult to plan monthly budgets and

            1. Build an Emergency Fund First
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Before you start investing, create an emergency fund that covers{" "}
            <strong>6–12 months</strong> of your essential expenses, including
            rent, EMIs, groceries, and medical costs. This fund should be easily
            accessible and kept in a liquid mutual fund or a sweep-in fixed
            deposit (FD).
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Example</strong>: If your average monthly expenses are
            ₹40,000, aim for an emergency corpus of ₹2.5–₹5 lakh in a liquid
            mutual fund or sweep-in FD.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
            2. Start SIPs in Mutual Funds
          </h3>

          <p className="mb-2">
            SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) are ideal for freelancers. Even
            with irregular income, small monthly investments compound
            significantly over time.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              Consider <strong>Index Funds</strong> which typically have lower
              expense ratios and are tax-efficient.
            </li>
            <li>Start with a flexi-SIP option if available.</li>
            <li>
              Diversify into equity, hybrid, and debt funds based on your risk
              profile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a <strong>SIP Calculator</strong> to estimate how much you
              need to invest monthly to reach your financial goals.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
            3. Use Tax-Advantaged Investment Tools
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Freelancers are eligible for several tax-saving options under{" "}
            <strong>Section 80C and 80CCD</strong>:
          </p>

          <Table columns={columns2} data={data2} />

          <p className="my-2">
            <strong>Example</strong>: A freelancer earning ₹10 lakhs can reduce
            their taxable income to ₹7 lakhs by investing in ELSS (₹1.5L) and
            NPS (₹1.5L including ₹50K under 80CCD(1B)).
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
            4. Retirement Planning Without EPF
          </h3>

          <p className="mb-2">
            As a freelancer, you must plan your own retirement. Begin investing
            early in:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              <strong>National Pension System (NPS)</strong> for regular pension
              after retirement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Equity mutual funds</strong> via SIPs for long-term
              growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>PPF</strong> as a safe, tax-free investment.
            </li>

            5. Get Insurance: Life + Health
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Investing is pointless if your financial future can be derailed by a
            hospital bill.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Term Insurance</strong>: A must-have for freelancers with
              dependents. It provides financial security in case of untimely
              demise.
