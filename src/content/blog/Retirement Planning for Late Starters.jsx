            1. Why ₹1 Crore Might Not Be Enough—But Still a Viable Milestone
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            For someone retiring at age 40, with expected living costs of ₹10
            lakh/year, a corpus of ₹2.5–3 crore is more realistic for lasting 50
            years post-retirement. Some experts recommend aiming for up to 65 ×
            annual expenses to stay inflation-adjusted.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            However, accumulating ₹1 crore is still valuable—it establishes
            discipline, confidence, and a foundation that can grow further over
            time. Start there, adjust upward later.

            2. Power of Compounding—Even When You Start Later
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            CA Nitin Kaushik’s projection: Starting SIP of ₹10,000/month at age
            25, with a 10% annual step-up and 12% CAGR, could yield ₹86 lakh by
            40, ₹4.3 crore by 50, and ₹8.8 crore by 55—demonstrating
            compounding’s exponential power.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Late starters (age 40) lose time—but not the potential: ₹20–35k SIP
            with systematic increases can still build ₹1 crore+ in ~15 years.

            Step A: Estimate Your Target Corpus
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Determine annual expenses at retirement (inflation-adjusted).
            Multiply by 33–65X depending on withdrawal rate and inflation
            assumptions.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Use SIP calculators to model scenarios:
            <br />
            ₹20,000/month for 15 years at ~12% = ₹1 crore.
            <br />
            ₹33,000/month for 20 years at ~15% = ₹5 crore corpus by age 60.

            Step B: Construct a Balanced Portfolio
          </h3>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Equity Mutual Funds</strong> (diversified index,
              large/mid/small-cap): Core growth engine targeting 10–15% CAGR.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>EPF + NPS</strong>: Mandatory EPF (~20–24% salary), tax
              advantages under Sections 80C/80CCD (up to ₹2 lakh) and part
              tax-free at maturity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>PPF</strong>: Government-guaranteed 7–8% returns, ideal
              for low-risk allocation and tax-free growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gold/FDP/International Equity</strong>: Additional hedge
              for diversification and inflation protection.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Step C: SIP Discipline and Step‑Up Strategy
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Start with whatever you can—e.g. ₹10,000/month—and increase annual
            contributions by 5–10% as income grows. Maintain SIP even during
            downturns—these are optimal entry points due to rupee‑cost
            averaging.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
            Step D: Periodic Rebalancing & Review
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Once a year, rebalance investment mix (equity vs debt) to manage
            risk and maintain target allocation. Replace underperforming funds,
            but don’t overtrade—discipline beats chasing returns.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold my-2 md:mt-4 md:mb-2">
            Step E: Emergency Fund & Insurance
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Keep at least 6–12 months of living expenses in liquid cash. Secure
            robust health and term insurance—medical costs and unforeseen
            emergencies can derail the best plans.

          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Many Indians express regret for late retirement planning—“1 in 3
            expect savings to deplete within 5 years of retirement,” and 90%
            wish they started earlier.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Rob Moore, a UK investor, emphasizes managing existing income over
            chasing high salary—discipline and frugality often beat big earnings
            in long-term wealth building.

            <li>
              <strong>Market timing</strong>: Don’t pause SIP during market
              dips—lower NAVs give more units.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Debt dependency</strong>: Avoid high-interest loans and

            Final Thoughts
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Yes, it's absolutely possible to become a crorepati after 40—but it
            requires clarity, consistency, and commitment. Even small SIPs, when
            sustained and elevated over time, harness the magic of compounding.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Pair that with intelligent use of tax-efficient tools like EPF, NPS,
            and PPF, an emergency buffer, and regular rebalancing—and you’re
            building not just wealth, but resilience.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            ₹1 crore can be your starting milestone—not the endpoint. Aim higher
            as you gain momentum. With discipline, smart planning, and time—even
            delayed entry can lead to financial independence and dignity in
            retirement.
