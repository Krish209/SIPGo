            <strong>Compounding</strong> is one of the most powerful forces in
            investing often referred to as the{" "}
            <strong>eighth wonder of the world</strong>. Compounding is the key
            to turning small, regular investments into substantial wealth over
            time. Whether you’re saving for retirement, a home, or your child’s
            education, harnessing compounding can dramatically boost your
            financial outcomes.

            What Is Compounding?
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            Compounding is the process by which the returns you earn on an
            investment begin to generate their own returns over time. In simple
            terms, you earn interest on the principal, and then you earn
            interest on that interest. Think of it as a snowball effect — your
            money grows faster as returns accumulate on both the principal and
            past gains.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-2">
            This cycle continues as long as your investment remains untouched
            and returns are reinvested, enabling your money to grow
            exponentially.

          <p className="mb-2">
            Let’s assume you invest ₹1,00,000 in a fixed deposit that gives an
            annual return of 7% compounded yearly.

          <Table columns={columns} data={data} />

          <p className="my-2">
            After 20 years, your ₹1 lakh grows to nearly ₹3.87 lakhs — without
            any additional investment! That’s the power of compounding. Notice
            how the growth accelerates in later years? That’s because your
            returns are now generating returns of their own.

              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to
                compound. Even small monthly contributions can snowball into a
                large corpus if you give them enough time. This is especially
                relevant for young investors in India who can benefit the most
                by starting early.

                To truly harness the power of compounding, reinvest your
                returns. Investment options like mutual funds (especially growth
                option), EPF, and PPF automatically reinvest returns, making
                them ideal compounding instruments.

                Small, regular investments benefit greatly from compounding.

            SIPs let you invest small amounts regularly and still enjoy

            an equity mutual fund via SIP at an average annual return of 12%.
            Here's how much wealth you could accumulate:

          <Table columns={columns2} data={data2} />

          <p className="my-2">
            As you can see, a ₹5,000 monthly SIP at 12% annual return grows to
            ~₹49 lakhs in 20 years—despite investing only ₹12 lakhs. The
            investment grows almost 4 times in 20 years due to compounding. The
            longer the duration, the more significant the compounding effect.

            The Role of Tax Efficiency in Compounding
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            While compounding helps your money grow, taxes can reduce your
            effective returns, especially if you're not investing in
            tax-efficient instruments. In India, different investment products
            are taxed differently, and choosing the right one can significantly
            impact your long-term wealth.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-2">
            Below is the common taxation on various investment options:

          <Table columns={columns4} data={data4} />

          <p className="my-2">
            Tax-efficient investments allow more of your returns to be
            reinvested, which supercharges the compounding effect over time.

            Inflation: The Silent Wealth Killer
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            While compounding helps grow your money, inflation eats into your
            purchasing power. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of your
            returns. For example, if your investment earns 8% annually but
            inflation is 6%, your real return is only 2%.
          </p>

          <Table columns={columns5} data={data5} />

          <p className="my-2">
            This illustrates that while FDs may feel safe, they often don’t beat
            inflation over the long term. Investments that provide higher real
            returns — like equity mutual funds — are essential for preserving
            and growing wealth.
