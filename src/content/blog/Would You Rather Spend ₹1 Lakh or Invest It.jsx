            The Instant Gratification of Spending ₹1 Lakh
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            When you receive a lump sum like ₹1 lakh, the urge to spend it
            immediately can be powerful. Spending is tangible and satisfying.
            Whether it’s upgrading your gadgets, enjoying a memorable
            experience, or fulfilling a long-held desire, spending offers:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              Immediate Joy: Buying something instantly gratifying gives a
              dopamine rush.
            </li>
            <li>
              Social Status: You might feel a social boost by showcasing new
              purchases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Emotional Comfort: Shopping can be a way to relieve stress or
              reward yourself.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-2">
            However, research in behavioral economics shows that the joy derived
            from spending often fades quickly—a phenomenon called the “hedonic
            treadmill.” After a few days or weeks, the excitement diminishes,
            leaving you back where you started.

          <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-4">
            Why Spending ₹1 Lakh May Not Be the Best Choice
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              Depreciating Assets: Most consumer goods lose value rapidly.
            </li>
            <li>
              No Passive Income: Purchased items don’t generate money or grow
              your wealth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opportunity Cost: Money spent cannot be invested to earn returns.
            </li>
            <li>
              No Financial Security: Doesn’t help in building emergency funds or
              future wealth.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Example: Buying a ₹1 lakh smartphone might give you happiness for a
            few months, but after that, it depreciates, and you may be stuck
            upgrading again soon.

            The Power of Investing ₹1 Lakh: Unlocking the Magic of Compounding
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            On the flip side, investing ₹1 lakh can be transformative if done
            wisely. The key lies in compounding—earning returns on your initial
            investment plus the returns generated previously. Albert Einstein
            reportedly called compound interest the “eighth wonder of the
            world,” and for good reason.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            How Does Compounding Work?
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Let’s say you invest ₹1 lakh in an equity mutual fund with an
            average annual return of 12%. Here’s how it grows:
          </p>

          <Table columns={columns} data={data} />
          <p className="mb-2">
            After 20 years, your ₹1 lakh could grow to nearly ₹10 lakh—almost a
            tenfold increase! This shows that a patient, disciplined approach to
            investing can drastically change your financial future.
