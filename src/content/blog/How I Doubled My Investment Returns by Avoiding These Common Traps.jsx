            Understanding the Root Causes of Investment Failures
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Before diving into the traps themselves, it’s essential to grasp why
            so many investors fall victim to them. The primary culprits are
            often:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Emotional Biases:</strong> Greed, fear, and impatience
              lead to irrational decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lack of Research:</strong> Blindly following trends or
              “hot tips” without verifying facts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Overconfidence:</strong> Believing in one’s ability to
              time the market perfectly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ignoring Risk:</strong> Neglecting to diversify and manage
              downside exposure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>High Costs:</strong> Overtrading and paying excessive fees
              eat into profits.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Recognizing these issues is the first step toward breaking free and
            enhancing your investment outcomes.

            The Top Investment Traps That Can Sabotage Your Returns (And How I
            Avoided Them)
          </h2>

          <div className="space-y-6">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-2">
                1. Chasing Market Hype and “Hot” Stocks
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Trap:</strong> When the media or social buzz hypes a
                stock or sector, the fear of missing out (FOMO) can push
                investors to buy at peak prices. This often leads to steep
                losses when the bubble bursts.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>My Experience:</strong> Early on, I chased hot tech
                stocks during market surges, only to suffer significant setbacks
                during corrections.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>How I Avoided It:</strong> I shifted my focus to
                fundamental analysis — examining a company’s earnings growth,
                debt levels, cash flow, and competitive advantages. This
                approach helped me identify undervalued stocks with genuine
                growth potential rather than speculative fads.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-2">
                2. Trying to Time the Market Instead of Time in the Market
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Trap:</strong> Many investors try to predict market
                highs and lows, selling before a dip and buying at a low. But
                timing the market consistently is nearly impossible—even for
                professionals.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>My Experience:</strong> I once sold investments during a
                downturn out of fear, missing out on a strong recovery that
                followed.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>How I Avoided It:</strong> I adopted a buy-and-hold
                strategy combined with rupee-cost averaging (DCA). Investing a
                fixed amount regularly allowed me to smooth out volatility and
                benefit from compounding growth over time.
              </p>

                3. Lack of Diversification — Putting All Eggs in One Basket
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Trap:</strong> Concentrating investments in one sector
                or asset class can lead to devastating losses if that area
                underperforms.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>My Experience:</strong> Heavy investments in one booming
                sector once backfired when the sector declined sharply.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>How I Avoided It:</strong> I diversified across stocks,
                bonds, ETFs, international markets, and real estate. This
                balance reduced portfolio risk and provided steadier returns.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-2">
                4. Overtrading and High Transaction Fees
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Trap:</strong> Frequent buying and selling rack up
                commission fees and taxes, which directly reduce net returns.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>My Experience:</strong> Early in my investing journey,
                overtrading caused my returns to lag behind market averages.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>How I Avoided It:</strong> I minimized transactions,
                favored low-cost index funds and ETFs, and held investments
                long-term to keep fees and taxes low.

                5. Letting Emotions Drive Decisions
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>Trap:</strong> Emotional reactions to market swings
                often cause panic selling or greedy buying at the wrong times.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>My Experience:</strong> I sold quality investments
                during short-term dips, missing their eventual rebound.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                <strong>How I Avoided It:</strong> I created an investment plan
                with clear goals and automated my contributions and rebalancing.
                This removed emotional impulses and kept me on track.
