            Inflation is a silent wealth eroder over time. In India, the
            Consumer Price Index (CPI) has averaged around 8.07% over the past
            decade. This means ₹100 today will only have the purchasing power of
            about ₹91.93 a decade from now. If your investments don’t keep up
            with inflation, your real returns could be negative. So, how can you
            protect and grow your money during inflationary times?

            Understanding Inflation's Impact
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            Inflation causes the general price level of goods and services to
            rise, reducing the purchasing power of money. For example, if
            inflation is 6% annually, an item costing ₹1,000 today will cost
            ₹1,060 next year. If your investment returns are lower than this
            rate, you are effectively losing money.

                1. Equity Mutual Funds
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Historically, equities have provided returns that outpace
                inflation. In India, equity mutual funds have delivered average
                returns of 12-15% over the long term. Investing in sectors with
                strong growth potential can help you earn real returns above
                inflation.

                2. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                TIPS are government bonds that adjust their principal based on
                inflation. While primarily available in the U.S., similar
                instruments exist globally. These provide guaranteed real
                returns above inflation, making them ideal for conservative
                investors.

              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Gold has traditionally been a reliable inflation hedge. In
                India, investing in gold via Sovereign Gold Bonds or gold ETFs
                protects against currency depreciation and rising prices.

              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                Real estate tends to appreciate with inflation. For those unable
                to invest directly, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) offer
                exposure to property markets. REITs have historically provided
                returns that exceed inflation, especially in urban growth areas.

              <p className="mb-2">
                Investing in commodities such as oil, natural gas, and
                agricultural products can protect against inflation. These
                assets often rise in value as inflation increases.

              </h3>

              <p className="mb-2">
                A well-diversified portfolio including equities, bonds, real
                estate, and commodities reduces risk and enhances returns.
                Regular rebalancing keeps your investments aligned with your
                financial goals and risk tolerance.

          <p className="mb-2">
            Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, highlights that investing
            in yourself is the best inflation hedge. Skills and expertise can
            command higher wages regardless of currency fluctuations. Buffett
            also advises investing in businesses with strong pricing power and
            low capital requirements, as these companies maintain profitability
            during inflationary periods.
