            intentions, many investors find their strategies underperforming,
            leaving them confused and frustrated about where things went wrong.
            The truth is, a failing investment strategy is often due not to bad
            luck but to avoidable mistakes.

            Why Investment Strategies Fail
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-6">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-2">
                1. Lack of Clear Financial Goals
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Without specific goals, your investment strategy lacks
                direction. Are you saving for retirement, buying a home, or
                funding education? Each objective requires a tailored approach
                with different risk tolerance and time horizons. Without clear
                goals, your investments may be misaligned, causing
                underperformance or unnecessary risk.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-2">
                2. Emotional Decision-Making
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Investing is often disrupted by emotions such as fear and greed.
                Market downturns may lead to panic selling, while booms tempt
                investors to chase trends. Emotional reactions cause investors
                to buy high and sell low, which damages long-term returns.
                Sticking to a disciplined strategy helps avoid costly emotional
                mistakes.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-2">
                3. Poor Diversification
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Concentrating investments in a few stocks or sectors increases
                risk. Lack of diversification can lead to significant losses if
                those investments perform poorly. A well-diversified portfolio
                balances exposure across various asset classes, sectors, and
                geographies, reducing volatility and improving stability.

                4. Attempting to Time the Market
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Trying to predict market highs and lows is difficult, even for
                professionals. Studies show that missing a few of the market’s
                best days can drastically reduce overall returns. Successful
                investors focus on staying invested for the long term rather
                than trying to time market movements.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-[17px] sm:text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-2">
                5. High Fees and Expenses
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Investment costs like management fees, transaction commissions,
                and taxes can quietly erode your gains. High fees compound over
                time and reduce net returns significantly. Choosing low-cost
                index funds and ETFs helps keep more of your money working for
                you.
              </p>

            <div>

                6. Neglecting Regular Portfolio Review
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Markets and personal circumstances change, so your portfolio
                needs periodic review and rebalancing. Ignoring this can lead to
                unintended risk exposures and cause your goals to drift out of
                reach. Regular reviews ensure your strategy remains aligned with
                your objectives.

                1. Set Clear, Measurable Financial Goals
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Clearly define what you want to achieve with your investments.
                Break down your goals by timeline and amount needed. For
                example, “I want to save ₹50,00,000 for retirement in 20 years”
                or “I need ₹15,00,000 for a home down payment in 5 years.” Clear
                goals guide your asset allocation and risk tolerance.

                2. Develop a Written Investment Plan
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Create a detailed plan that includes your goals, risk tolerance,
                asset allocation, and investment selection criteria. A written
                plan keeps you disciplined and less likely to make impulsive
                decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.

                3. Diversify Your Portfolio
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Spread your investments across asset classes such as stocks,
                bonds, real estate, and cash. Within stocks, diversify by sector
                and geography. This strategy helps mitigate risks and smooth
                returns over time, protecting you from market shocks.

                4. Adopt a Long-Term Mindset
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Investing is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay invested through
                market ups and downs to benefit from compounding growth.
                “Rupee-cost averaging” is great localized terminology—consider
                adding a brief explanation for global readers (e.g., “investing
                a fixed amount regularly regardless of market conditions”).

                5. Minimize Fees and Expenses
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Choose investment vehicles with low expense ratios such as index
                funds and ETFs. Limit frequent trading to reduce transaction
                costs. Consider tax-efficient accounts like PPF and EPF to
                improve after-tax returns.

                6. Review and Rebalance Regularly
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Set a schedule to review your portfolio at least annually.
                Rebalance by adjusting allocations back to your target
                percentages, selling overweight assets and buying underweight
                ones. This maintains your desired risk level and keeps your
                strategy on track.

            <div>

                7. Continue Educating Yourself
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Stay informed about investing principles, market trends, and
                financial news. Read books, follow credible finance websites,
                and consider consulting a financial advisor to make
                well-informed decisions.
