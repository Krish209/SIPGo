              1. The Legendary "Bob" Experiment: Worst Timing, Best Outcome
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              An instructive case study: Bob, a hypothetical investor spent
              years saving, but consistently purchased market peaks just before
              crashes:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
              <li>Dec 1972: invested $6K, followed by ~50% market crash</li>
              <li>Aug 1987: $46K before the −34% crash</li>
              <li>Dec 1999: $68K at the tech bubble peak (~−49%)</li>
              <li>Oct 2007: $64K just prior to the subprime crash (~−52%)</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Bob never sold through any downturn. By late 2013, his total
              investment of ~$184K had grown to $1.1M — despite horrendous
              timing. Had he used rupee-cost averaging instead of lump sums, his
              outcome could have reached ~$2.3M.

              Lesson: Even the worst market timing couldn’t derail the power of
              compounding and long-term holding.

              2. Why "Time in the Market" Usually Outperforms Timing It
            </h2>

            <h3 className="font-semibold">Explosive Compound Growth</h3>
            <p className="mb-2">
              The real driver of wealth is compound interest—your returns
              generate returns. For instance, ₹5 lakh growing at 18% annually
              over 20 years could become ₹1.37 crore.

              <li>
                Missing just the 10 best trading days per decade in the S&P 500
                slashes cumulative returns drastically.
              </li>
              <li>
                Markets recover even severe dips over time—buy-and-hold allows
                you to recoup losses faster than keeping cash or bonds.

                <strong>Q1: Is it safe to never sell stocks?</strong>
                <p>
                  A: For long-term investors selecting diversified, high-quality
                  holdings, it can lead to significant growth—though personal
                  needs and business health may necessitate occasional selling.

                <strong>Q2: Why hold stocks forever?</strong>
                <p>
                  A: Because compounding amplifies returns over time, taxes and
                  transaction costs are minimized, and you avoid behavioral
                  pitfalls like trading on emotion or missing key growth
                  periods.

                <strong>Q3: What are the risks of never selling?</strong>
                <p>
                  A: Poor stock choices, sector obsolescence, opportunity cost,
                  and emergencies can force ill-timed sales or stagnation.

                <strong>Q4: When should I break my "never-sell" rule?</strong>
                <p>
                  A: If company fundamentals change severely, valuations are
                  extreme, you need liquidity, or you're reallocating due to
                  portfolio imbalance.

              During the early-2025 market slump triggered by global trade
