            When it comes to managing personal finances, the terms{" "}
            <strong>saving</strong> and <strong>investing</strong> are often
            used interchangeably. However, understanding the difference between
            saving and investing is crucial for building long-term wealth and
            achieving your financial goals. While both involve setting aside
            money for the future, they serve different purposes and carry
            varying levels of risk and reward.

            What Is Saving?
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Saving</strong> means setting aside a portion of your income
            in a <strong>safe and easily accessible</strong> place—such as a{" "}
            <strong>savings account, fixed deposit (FD)</strong>, or{" "}
            <strong>recurring deposit (RD)</strong>. The main goal of saving is{" "}
            <strong>capital preservation</strong>—you want your money to stay
            safe and be available when needed.

            Key Features of Saving
          </h2>

          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Low Risk</strong>: Funds are kept in secure accounts with
              guaranteed returns.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>High Liquidity</strong>: Easily accessible for emergencies
              or short-term needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Low Returns</strong>: Interest rates are usually low (3%
              to 7% per annum), barely keeping up with inflation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Short-Term Focus</strong>: Best for short-term goals like
              vacations, emergency funds, or upcoming expenses.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Example</strong>: Suppose you save ₹10,000 every month in a
            high-interest savings account offering 4% interest. After one year,
            you'd have ₹1,20,000 in contributions and approximately ₹2,448 in
            interest (compounded annually), totaling ₹1,22,448. The main benefit
            here is safety and liquidity, not growth.

            What Is Investing?
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Investing</strong> means putting your money into financial
            instruments such as{" "}
            <strong>stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate</strong>, or{" "}
            <strong>gold</strong> with the aim of generating higher returns over
            time. Investments carry more risk but also offer the greater
            potential rewards. The primary goal of investing is{" "}
            <strong>wealth creation</strong>.

          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Medium to High Risk</strong>: Investment values can
              fluctuate; capital loss is possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Variable Liquidity</strong>: Some investments may have
              lock-in periods or be less liquid than savings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Higher Returns</strong>: Returns may range from 10% to 15%
              or more, depending on the asset class.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-Term Focus</strong>: Best for long-term financial
              goals like retirement, wealth accumulation, or funding children's
              education.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Example</strong>: If you invest ₹10,000 monthly in a mutual
            fund with an average annual return of 12%, after one year, you'd
            have contributed ₹1,20,000. With compounding, this could grow to
            approximately ₹1,28,093—including ₹8,093 in returns. After 10 years,
            compounding can grow your wealth to ₹23,23,391—far beyond what
            savings alone can achieve.
