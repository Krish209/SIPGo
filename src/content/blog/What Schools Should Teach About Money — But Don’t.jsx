          <p className="mb-2">
            Despite being fundamental life skills, many financial literacy
            topics—such as budgeting, credit management, and investing—are
            rarely taught in schools. Most curricula emphasize academics like
            science and math but omit practical money management entirely.

            Why Financial Education Must Be a Core Subject
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Financial habits form early</strong>: Teenagers exposed to
              structured finance education develop stronger budgeting, saving,
              and spending behaviors later in life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Avoid lifelong pitfalls</strong>: Without financial
              knowledge, young adults fall prey to bad debt, poor saving habits,
              and limited retirement planning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Widening inequality</strong>: Groups without access to
              financial education— especially low-income students—are more
              vulnerable to predatory lending and financial scams.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Academic engagement</strong>: Financial lessons can
              demystify math by applying it to real-life scenarios, increasing
              student motivation and understanding.

            Core Financial Topics Schools Should Teach
          </h2>

          <ol className="list-decimal space-y-4 pl-6 mb-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Budgeting & Saving</strong>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Teach students to distinguish between wants and needs, and adopt
                the 50‑30‑20 rule (needs/wants/savings). Encourage goal-setting
                and using worksheets or apps for expense tracking.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Banking & Financial Services</strong>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Explain how to open savings and checking accounts, avoid
                overdraft fees, and use online/digital banking safely. Introduce
                digital wallets, UPI, and cybersecurity basics.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Credit & Debt Management</strong>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Cover credit cards, loans, interest rates, credit scores,
                consequences of debt, and predatory lending. Focus on
                responsible borrowing and delaying harmful credit decisions.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Investing & Compound Interest</strong>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Explain basic instruments—stocks, bonds, mutual funds—alongside
                simulations to show how diversification, risk, and compounding
                work. Highlight the benefits of long-term planning like
                retirement funds.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Taxes & Legal Responsibilities</strong>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Teach why taxes exist, how different types are calculated, and
                simplified tax-filing exercises. Include deduction basics and
                benefits like insurance or retirement contributions.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Insurance & Risk Management</strong>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Clarify health, term life, and property insurance. Use real-life
                scenarios to show how insurance guards against financial risk.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Behavioral Finance & Consumer Awareness</strong>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Address emotional and psychological drivers behind financial
                decisions: impulse buying, overconfidence, social pressure,
                confirmation bias. Programs like the FoolProof Initiative teach
                healthy skepticism through real-life video modules and games.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Digital Finance & Emerging Tools</strong>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Cover BNPL schemes, cryptocurrencies, digital payment apps, and
                fraud prevention. Emphasize verifying sources, secure password
                habits, and phishing awareness.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Entrepreneurship & Financial Planning</strong>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Teach business ideation, budgeting, prototyping, and
                grant-seeking. Use Delhi’s NEEEV initiative as a model example
                for entrepreneurship curriculum implementation.

              <strong>Crowded curriculums & test pressures</strong>: Essential
              for academics, life skills like money management often get
              deprioritized.

            <li>
              <strong>Lack of teacher confidence</strong>: Most teachers haven’t

          <p className="mb-2">
            Financial literacy is no longer optional—it’s essential. While
            academic knowledge is vital, real-world money skills impact lifelong
            success and well-being. From budgeting and banking to behavioral
            finance and entrepreneurship, schools play a pivotal role in
            bridging this gap—but most still lag behind.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            By integrating practical finance education across subjects, training
            teachers, leveraging global models (like Aflatoun, MyBnk, FoolProof,
            NEEEV, FMM), and actively engaging communities, schools can equip
            students with the confidence and competence to manage money wisely.
            That foundation helps reduce stress, minimize debt traps, spark
            economic opportunity, and shape financially empowered citizens.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Schoolcurricula must evolve: because teaching real-world money
            skills is as important as teaching calculus or language—and failure
            to adapt leaves students underprepared. Let’s push for change,
            champion financial education in schools, and give every student the
            tools to succeed financially.
