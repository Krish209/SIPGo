          <p className="mb-2">
            In an increasingly digital world, your digital
            assets‚Äîcryptocurrency, NFTs, online accounts, cloud memories, and
            more‚Äîare becoming vital parts of your estate. With billions in
            digital wealth unclaimed every year, planning for how these assets
            are inherited is no longer optional‚Äîit‚Äôs essential. This guide
            explains why digital inheritance matters, how to inventory and
            protect these assets, and how to pass them on legally, securely, and
            seamlessly.

          <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-4">
            1. Why Digital Assets Are Becoming Critical in Estate Planning
          </h2>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">
            A. Rising Financial and Sentimental Value
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            In 2024, the number of Australian wills including cryptocurrency
            doubled, with average crypto holdings around AUD 20,300‚Äîhighlighting
            the growing monetary value of digital inheritance. In many
            households, digital content‚Äîfrom cloud photos to YouTube
            channels‚Äîholds emotional legacies as well.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">
            B. Loss Risks Without Proper Planning
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Without a plan, heirs can be locked out entirely: forgotten seed
            phrases, lost login credentials, or inaccessible accounts could
            result in permanent losses. An estimated 20% of Bitcoin supply is
            now permanently unrecoverable due to poor succession planning.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">C. Emotional Toll</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Families are deprived not solely of money, but of priceless
            memories: private messages, digital journals, and photo archives.
            Losing such digital content can inflict surprising emotional damage.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">D. Legal Recognition</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            In England and Wales, crypto is officially recognized as property
            and can be included in wills but requires safe treatment of private
            keys to avoid public exposure. In the US, most states now follow
            RUFADAA, enabling fiduciaries to gain access to digital assets‚Äîbut
            only with explicit authorizations or platform legacy settings in
            place.

            2. Understanding the Types of Digital Assets
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Digital assets span multiple categories, including financial,
            sentimental, and intellectual property holdings.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Financial assets:</strong> Cryptocurrencies, online bank
              or investment accounts, PayPal, Venmo, domain names, e-commerce
              storefronts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sentimental and social assets:</strong> Email, social
              media profiles, cloud-stored photos/videos, blogs, forums.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Intellectual property/business assets:</strong> Websites,
              blogs, YouTube or Twitch channels, affiliate income, NFTs or DeFi
              holdings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Access credentials & devices:</strong> Hardware wallets,
              external drives, password managers, devices storing digital keys.
            </li>
          </ul>

        {/* 3. Legal & Practical Challenges */}
        <section className="my-4 md:my-8">
          <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-4">
            3. Legal & Practical Challenges
          </h2>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">
            A. Access Restrictions / Platform Terms
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Most platforms prohibit transferring account credentials to others.
            Without legacy settings or account authorization, access can be
            denied or accounts deleted on death‚Äîeven by close relatives.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">
            B. Privacy Laws & Fiduciary Legislation
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Fiduciary access laws like RUFADAA in the US give fiduciaries access
            only if consent is recorded via will, trust, or online service
            tools. In the EU, GDPR's post‚Äëmortem personal data rights can also
            restrict access without explicit instructions.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">C. Security of Credentials</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Seed phrases, private keys, 2FA codes‚Äîif not properly recorded and
            stored‚Äîcan render digital assets permanently inaccessible. Informal
            systems (emails, texts) are insecure or violate platform policies.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">D. Rapidly Evolving Technology</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Digital assets and platforms evolve. PDF formats, wallet types,
            platform terms all change over time‚Äîmaking periodic updates
            essential to maintain access.

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              <strong>‚úÖ Step‚ÄØ1: Comprehensive Inventory</strong>
              <br />
              Create a detailed inventory of all digital assets and platforms,
              including usernames, approximate values, and access details :
              wallet addresses, exchanges, seed locations, email or cloud
              accounts, social profiles, domains, websites, and devices. Include
              instructions and support contacts where relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>üõ° Step‚ÄØ2: Secure Storage & Access Framework</strong>
              <br />
              Use password managers or secure vaults. Store crypto access info
              in encrypted formats‚Äînever directly in wills. Refer to sealed
              letters or encrypted files via legal documents.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>
                üë§ Step‚ÄØ3: Appoint a Tech‚ÄëSavvy Digital Executor or Trustee
              </strong>
              <br />
              Select someone with technical competence or hire a digital
              fiduciary. Outline responsibilities and provide legal
              authorization.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>üìù Step‚ÄØ4: Legal Instruments & Memorandums</strong>
              <br />
              Use digital asset trusts, digital wills or codicils, and letters
              of instruction. Avoid exposing sensitive keys in public legal
              records.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>üîó Step‚ÄØ5: Use Platform Legacy Features</strong>
              <br />
              Enable built-in tools like Google Inactive Account Manager,
              Facebook Legacy Contact, Apple Legacy Contact for smoother
              transitions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>üîÑ Step‚ÄØ6: Tax Planning & Legal Compliance</strong>
              <br />
              Document cost basis, acquisition dates. Consider trusts, gifting,
              and tax rules like the IRS step-up basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>üìÖ Step‚ÄØ7: Regular Review & Updates</strong>
              <br />
              Update your plan annually or after major changes. Keep your
              digital inventory and legal documents current.
