          What is NSC?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The <strong>National Savings Certificate (NSC)</strong> is a
          government-backed savings scheme that offers a safe and reliable
          investment option for individuals aiming to grow their savings while
          enjoying tax benefits. It is ideal for risk-averse investors and
          taxpayers who wish to reduce their taxable income. Despite its lock-in
          period and taxable interest, NSC remains a dependable choice due to
          its fixed returns and sovereign guarantee.

          How Does NSC Work?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          When you purchase an NSC at a Post Office, the amount you invest earns
          a fixed interest rate compounded annually. The interest is added to
          the principal every year and is paid out only at maturity (after 5
          years).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          For example, if you invest ₹1,000 in NSC at an interest rate of 6.8%,
          the interest is calculated every year on the total principal. At the
          end of the 5-year tenure, you will receive the total principal along
          with compounded interest.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-4">
          Interest Rates on NSC
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The interest rate on NSC is fixed by the government and is subject to
          quarterly revisions. As of Q2 FY 2025, the interest rate is 7.7% per
          annum.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The interest on NSC is compounded annually, meaning interest is added
          to the principal every year and earns more interest in subsequent
          years. The total interest is paid at maturity.
