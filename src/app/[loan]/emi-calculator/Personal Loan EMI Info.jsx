      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">What is a Personal Loan?</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        A personal loan is a sum of money borrowed from a bank, credit union, or online lender, which is repaid in fixed monthly installments (EMIs) over a predetermined period. Unlike secured loans, personal loans are mostly unsecured, meaning no collateral or asset is required to secure the loan. This makes personal loans convenient for borrowers but may come with higher interest rates.
