        Personal Loan - A Comprehensive Guide
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-2">
        Personal loans are one of the most popular financial products used by
        millions worldwide to meet urgent financial needs. This guide covers
        what a personal loan is, its types, eligibility criteria, interest
        rates, benefits, drawbacks, application process, and tips for choosing

          What is a Personal Loan?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          A personal loan is a sum of money borrowed from a bank, credit union,
          or online lender, which is repaid in fixed monthly installments (EMIs)
          over a predetermined period. Unlike secured loans, personal loans are
          mostly unsecured, meaning no collateral or asset is required to secure
          the loan. This makes personal loans convenient for borrowers but may
          come with higher interest rates.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Personal loans can be used for various purposes, such as:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-2">
          <li>Debt consolidation</li>
          <li>Medical emergencies</li>
          <li>Home renovation or repairs</li>
          <li>Education expenses</li>
          <li>Wedding or travel costs</li>
          <li>Unexpected financial emergencies</li>
