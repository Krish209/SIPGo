        <p className="mb-2">
          An <strong>education loan</strong> (or student loan) is a financial
          product designed to help students pay for higher education expenses,
          including <em>tuition fees</em>, accommodation, books, study
          materials, travel costs, and other education-related expenses.
          Education loans are typically repaid in installments after the student
          completes their course, with interest charged on the borrowed amount.
