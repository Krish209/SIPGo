      question: "What is Simple Interest?",
      answer:
        "Simple Interest is a method of calculating interest on a fixed principal amount over a specific period. It is calculated only on the original principal, not on any accumulated interest.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between Simple Interest and Compound Interest?",
      answer:
        "1. Simple Interest: Calculated only on the principal amount throughout the investment or loan period.\n2. Compound Interest: Calculated on both the principal and the accumulated interest, resulting in higher returns or costs over time.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does Rate of Interest mean?",
      answer:
        "The Rate of Interest is the percentage charged or earned on a principal amount annually. It may vary depending on the type of investment or loan and the agreed terms.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I calculate Simple Interest for a partial year?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can calculate Simple Interest for part of a year. Convert the time into a fraction of a year, such as 6 months = 0.5 years. For days, divide the number of days by 365:\n\nSI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Simple Interest always calculated annually?",
      answer:
        "No, Simple Interest can be calculated monthly, quarterly, or for any custom period. Adjust the time in the formula to reflect the correct time unit in years.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Simple Interest be negative?",
      answer:
        "Simple Interest is usually positive, representing earnings or cost. However, in rare scenarios like negative interest rate environments, it can become negative, reducing what you owe or earn.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of Simple Interest?",
      answer:
        "Benefits of Simple Interest include:\n\n1. Simple and easy to calculate.\n2. Fixed interest amount throughout the term.\n3. Clear and predictable repayments.\n4. Lower cost compared to compound interest in most cases.",
    },
