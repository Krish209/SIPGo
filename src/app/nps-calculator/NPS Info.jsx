          What is NPS?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>National Pension System (NPS)</strong> is a
          government-backed retirement scheme designed to help individuals
          systematically save and invest for their retirement. Subscribers can
          contribute regularly during their working years, and the funds are
          invested in a diversified mix of equities, corporate bonds, and
          government securities. At retirement, a portion of the accumulated
          corpus is used to provide a steady monthly pension, while the rest can
          be withdrawn as a lump sum.

          How does NPS work?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          NPS works by allowing individuals to contribute to their retirement
          account during their working years. The contributions are invested in
          different asset classes (equity, corporate bonds, government
          securities) according to the investor's risk preference. The
          accumulated amount can be used to provide a monthly pension after the
          individual reaches the age of 60.

            NPS Formula:
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-2 md:mb-4">
            The formula used to calculate the NPS corpus is:
          </p>

          <code className="font-bold">A = P × (1 + r/n)^(nt)</code>

          <p className="mt-2">Where:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>A</strong> = Amount of money accumulated after n years,
              including interest
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>P</strong> = Invested amount
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>r</strong> = Annual interest rate
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>n</strong> = Number of compounding periods per year
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>t</strong> = Number of years the money is invested or
              borrowed for
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-2 mt-4 font-semibold">Example:</p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Let's take the example of Mr. Shyam, a 30-year-old employee working in
          a government sector. He decides to invest in the{" "}
          <strong>National Pension Scheme (NPS)</strong> to secure his
          retirement. Mr. Shyam will make monthly contributions of ₹5,000
          towards the scheme with expected annual return rate of 8%, which he
          plans to continue until age 60.
        </p>
        <ul className="space-y-2 mb-4 pl-2">
          <li>- Monthly Investment (P) = ₹5,000</li>
          <li>- Expected Annual Return Rate (r) = 8% (0.08)</li>
          <li>- Number of times interest is compounded per year (n) = 1</li>
          <li>
            - Total Number of years the money is invested (t) = 60 - 30 = 30
            years
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Mr. Shyam will contribute ₹5,000 every month for 30 years. His total
          contribution over the entire period will be ₹18,00,000 (₹5,000 × 12
          months × 30 years).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Using the NPS formula, the projected corpus at retirement will be
          ₹75,01,476. This means Mr. Shyam earned ₹57,01,476 in interest over
          the investment period.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          At retirement, Mr. Shyam decides to allocate 40% of his corpus to buy
          an annuity, which will provide him with a steady monthly pension. The
          amount allocated to the annuity is ₹30,00,590, and the annuity return
          rate is 6%.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Based on these figures, Mr. Shyam can expect an estimated monthly
          pension of ₹15,003. The remaining ₹45,00,886 can be withdrawn as a
          lump sum, tax-free.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This ensures that Mr. Shyam will have both a lump sum to access
          immediately and a monthly pension that will help him manage his
          expenses throughout retirement.

          Structure of NPS
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">The NPS operates on a two-tier system:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Tier 1 Account</strong>: This is the primary account used
            for retirement savings. The contributions made in this account are
            subject to withdrawal only upon retirement or in special cases such
            as the death of the subscriber (account holder).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tier 2 Account</strong>: This is a voluntary savings account
            that offers more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. It is not
            mandatory and can be opened alongside Tier 1.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-2">
          Subscribers can invest according to their financial capacity and
          retirement goals. Each subscriber to NPS is assigned a unique
          identifier called the{" "}
          <strong>Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN)</strong>, which
          tracks the contributions and status of the account.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

            there is no minimum contribution for opening, but regular deposits
            can be made.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Voluntary Contributions</strong>: NPS allows flexible

            account, the customer has to pay the total of minimum contributions

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Normal Exit</strong>: At the age of 60, a subscriber must

            <strong>Premature Exit</strong>: If a subscriber exits before 60, at
