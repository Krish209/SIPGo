      question: "What is an EMI?",
      answer:
        "An EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is a fixed monthly payment a borrower makes to a lender on a specific date. It includes both principal and interest and is used to repay a loan over a set period.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the components of an EMI?",
      answer:
        "EMI consists of two parts: principal (the borrowed amount) and interest (the cost of borrowing). The EMI ensures both are paid off over the loan tenure.",
    },
    {
      question: "What factors affect the EMI amount?",
      answer:
        "1. Loan Amount\n2. Interest Rate\n3. Loan Tenure\n\nHigher loan amount, interest rate, or longer tenure increases the EMI.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I prepay or make part payments to reduce my EMI?",
      answer:
        "Yes, many lenders allow prepayment or part payments which reduce the outstanding loan, lowering your EMI or loan tenure depending on lender terms.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a penalty for prepaying the EMI?",
      answer:
        "Some lenders may charge a prepayment penalty, while others don’t. Always check your loan agreement for prepayment terms.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can my EMI increase if interest rates rise?",
      answer:
        "For floating rate loans, EMI can increase if interest rates rise. For fixed-rate loans, EMI stays the same throughout the tenure.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does a longer loan tenure impact EMI?",
      answer:
        "Longer tenure lowers the EMI amount but increases total interest paid. Shorter tenure means higher EMI but less interest overall.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change the EMI amount during the loan tenure?",
      answer:
        "It depends on your lender. Some allow EMI changes through loan restructuring or refinancing. Check with your lender for options.",
    },
