        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The <strong>Public Provident Fund (PPF)</strong> is a
          government-backed investment scheme aimed at promoting long-term
          savings. It offers a combination of{" "}
          <strong>tax benefits, guaranteed and attractive returns,</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>safety</strong>, making it one of the most preferred savings
          instruments in India. The Ministry of Finance sets the interest rate,
          which is subject to change.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          To maximize the benefits of your PPF investment, it is beneficial to
          make your deposit{" "}
          <strong>between April 1st and April 5th each financial year</strong>.
          This ensures that your deposit is accounted for in the current
          financial year, and you begin earning interest from the start of the
          year. If a lump-sum deposit isn't feasible to make a full year's
          deposit at once, you can make{" "}
          <strong>monthly deposits by the 5th of each month</strong> to maximize
          interest accrual.
