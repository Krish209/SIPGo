          What is GST?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>GST (Goods and Services Tax)</strong> is a value-added tax
          applied to the sale of goods and services. It is designed to simplify
          the taxation process by consolidating multiple indirect taxes, such as
          sales tax, excise duty, and VAT (Value Added Tax), into a single tax
          structure. GST is typically levied at different stages of production
          or distribution and is paid by consumers at the point of sale, while
          businesses collect it and remit it to the government.

          GST Calculation Formula

        {/* GST Exclusive Calculation */}
        <p className="mb-2">
          When the selling price is <strong>GST Exclusive</strong> (i.e., GST is
          not included in the price):
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-2 md:p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <code>GST amount = (Selling Price × GST Rate) / 100</code>
          <br />
          <code>Net Price = Selling Price + GST amount</code>
        </div>
        <p className="my-2">
          For example, if a product costs ₹1000 and the GST rate is 18%, the GST
          would be:
        </p>
        <code>GST amount = (1000 × 18) / 100 = ₹180</code>
        <p className="my-2">
          So, the final price to the consumer would be ₹1180 (₹1000 + ₹180).
        </p>

        {/* GST Inclusive Calculation */}
        <p className="mb-2 mt-4">
          When the selling price is <strong>GST Inclusive</strong> (i.e., GST is
          included in the price):

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-2 md:p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">

          <br />
          <code>Original Price = Selling Price - GST amount</code>
        </div>
        <p className="my-2">
          For example, if the selling price of a product is ₹1180 (inclusive of
          GST) and the GST rate is 18%, the GST amount would be:
        </p>
        <code>GST amount = (1180 × 18) / (100 + 18) = ₹180</code>
        <p className="my-2">
          The original price (before GST) would be: ₹1180 - ₹180 = ₹1000
