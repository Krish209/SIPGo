    },
    {
      question: "What is the GST rate in India?",

    },
    {
      question: "Is GST applicable on exports?",
      answer:
        "Exports are zero-rated under GST, meaning they are exempt from GST. Exporters can claim refunds on input taxes paid on goods or services related to exports, ensuring exports are not taxed.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a business fails to comply with GST?",
      answer:
        "Non-compliance can lead to penalties, interest on late payments, and legal action. Penalties include late filing of returns, failure to pay GST, and providing incorrect information in returns. The penalty amount varies based on the violation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are GST returns?",
      answer:
