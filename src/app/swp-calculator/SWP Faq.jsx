      question: "What is SWP (Systematic Withdrawal Plan)?",
      answer:
        "A Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) allows you to withdraw a fixed amount from your mutual fund investment at regular intervals. It provides steady income and is the reverse of a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP).",
    },
    {
      question: "How does SWP work?",
      answer:
        "In SWP, you invest a lump sum in a mutual fund and schedule fixed periodic withdrawals—monthly, quarterly, or annually. The fund redeems the required number of units, while the remaining investment continues to earn returns.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change the withdrawal amount or frequency in SWP?",
      answer:
        "Yes, most mutual fund platforms allow you to modify the withdrawal amount and frequency at any time based on your financial needs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is SWP taxable?",
      answer:
        "Yes. SWP withdrawals are subject to capital gains tax. For equity funds, LTCG tax applies if held for over 1 year, while STCG tax applies for shorter periods. Taxation varies for debt funds based on holding period and fund type.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use SWP for retirement planning?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. SWP is widely used in retirement planning to generate a regular income stream while keeping the remaining capital invested for long-term growth.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I set up an SWP?",
      answer:
        "You can start an SWP by investing a lump sum in a mutual fund and selecting the SWP option via the fund’s website, investment platform, or financial advisor. Set the withdrawal amount and frequency as per your preference.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if my mutual fund performs poorly during SWP?",
      answer:
        "If fund performance declines, more units may be redeemed to maintain your withdrawal amount. This may reduce your corpus faster, especially in prolonged market downturns.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a minimum amount for SWP?",
      answer:
        "Yes, most mutual fund houses require a minimum SWP withdrawal amount—usually ₹500 or ₹1,000 per installment. Check with your fund for exact details.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stop my SWP anytime?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can cancel or pause your SWP anytime by notifying your mutual fund or updating your request online. Ensure this aligns with your financial goals before making changes.",
    },
