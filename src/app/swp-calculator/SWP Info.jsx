          What is a SWP?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          A <strong>Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)</strong> is a financial
          planning tool that allows investors to withdraw a fixed amount of
          money from their mutual fund investments at regular intervals. It
          works in the opposite way compared to a SIP. While SIPs involve
          regularly investing small amounts, SWPs allow you to withdraw a fixed
          amount periodically, rather than redeeming your entire investment at
          once. SWP enables fixed, periodic withdrawals, thereby ensuring a
          steady cash flow.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          SWPs are particularly useful for retirees or individuals who need
          regular cash flow from their investments. By setting up an SWP,
          investors can ensure that they receive a consistent amount of money at
          predetermined intervals, which can help in budgeting and managing
          expenses.

          <li>
            <strong>Flexibility</strong>: Allows withdrawal of fixed amounts
            over time, offering a steady income stream.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choice of Frequency</strong>: Withdrawals can be scheduled
            monthly, quarterly, or annually based on your liquidity needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taxation</strong>: Only the capital gains portion of each
            withdrawal is subject to tax, not the full amount withdrawn.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Growth Potential</strong>: Even as you withdraw, your
            remaining units stay invested and may benefit from market growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Applicability</strong>: Works with most mutual fund schemes
            (equity, debt, hybrid, etc.)

      {/* How it Works */}
      <section className="my-4 md:my-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-4">
          How Does SWP Work?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          To set up an SWP, you first need to invest a lump sum amount in a
          mutual fund scheme. After that, you can choose the amount you want to
          withdraw and the frequency of withdrawals. For example, if you invest
          ₹10,00,000 in a mutual fund and set up an SWP of ₹10,000 per month,
          you will receive ₹10,000 every month from your investment. The mutual
          fund house redeems a certain number of units to meet your withdrawal
          request, and the remaining units will continue to stay invested in the
          fund.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The withdrawn amount may be subject to capital gains tax, depending on
          the type of mutual fund and the holding period of your investment. For
          example, if you withdraw from an equity fund after one year, the
          long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax will apply. If you withdraw from a
          debt fund before three years, the short-term capital gains (STCG) tax
          will apply.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          SWPs are flexible, allowing investors to adjust the withdrawal amount
          or frequency as needed. You can also stop the SWP at any time, but
          it’s essential to plan your withdrawals carefully to avoid depleting
          your investment too quickly.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Since mutual funds are market-linked investments, the withdrawal
          amount may vary depending on the{" "}
          <strong>NAV (Net Asset Value)</strong> of the scheme at the time of
          withdrawal. In simple terms, the amount withdrawn depends on the value
          of your mutual fund units. For example, if the NAV is ₹50, then 200
          units (₹10,000 ÷ ₹50) will be redeemed to meet the withdrawal amount
          of ₹10,000.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The formula used to calculate the amount withdrawn is:

          <li>
            <strong>Fixed Amount SWP</strong>: The investor sets a fixed amount
            to be withdrawn periodically. This is the most common type of SWP,
            where you receive a fixed sum every month or year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fixed Percentage SWP</strong>: Instead of withdrawing a
            fixed amount, you can choose to withdraw a fixed percentage of your
            mutual fund's balance at regular intervals. This method is more
            dynamic as it adjusts with the performance of your mutual fund and
            market conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Variable SWP</strong>: In this type of SWP, the amount
            withdrawn varies based on certain criteria, such as market
            conditions, fund performance, and investor preferences.

          <li>
            <strong>Market Risk</strong>: NAVs fluctuate; during market

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Discipline Required</strong>: Avoid impulsive changes; plan

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Capital Depletion</strong>: If withdrawal exceeds returns,
            the corpus will deplete over time. So, never exceed 4-6% of corpus
            annually to avoid depletion.
          </li>

          SWPs from mutual funds are subject to capital gains tax on the gains
          portion of the withdrawal, not the entire amount. Here’s a breakdown

            <strong>Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG)</strong>: If you hold equity

            10%, with no indexation benefits.

            For investments made <strong>before April 1, 2023</strong>, if you

            your income tax slab rate. If held for more than 3 years, the gains

          Systematic Withdrawal Plans (SWPs) provide an excellent way to create
          a consistent income stream from mutual fund investments. Whether you
          are a retiree or just looking for regular withdrawals, SWP can provide
          the right balance between income and capital preservation. When
          implemented wisely—considering tax implications, market conditions,
          and withdrawal rates—SWPs can help maintain financial stability while
          preserving your investment corpus.
