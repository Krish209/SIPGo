      question: "What is a Recurring Deposit (RD)?",
      answer:
        "A Recurring Deposit (RD) is a fixed deposit investment where you deposit a fixed amount monthly for a set period. It encourages disciplined savings and earns interest, which is paid at maturity or as per the scheme.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who is eligible to open an RD account?",
      answer:
        "Indian residents, including minors with a guardian, can open an RD account. NRIs (Non-Resident Indians) may also open one under specific terms set by the bank.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the minimum and maximum investment in RD?",
      answer:
        "The minimum monthly deposit typically starts from ₹100 to ₹500, depending on the bank. There’s usually no maximum limit, but deposits must be in multiples of ₹10 or ₹100, as per bank rules.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the interest rate on an RD account?",
      answer:
        "Recurring Deposit interest rates generally range from 5.5% to 7.5% per annum and are fixed at the time of account opening. Rates may vary by bank and scheme.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the typical tenure for an RD?",
      answer:
        "The tenure for an RD ranges from 6 months to 10 years. Most banks offer terms of 1 to 5 years as the standard investment duration.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is RD interest taxable in India?",
      answer:
        "Yes, interest earned on an RD is taxable as per your income tax slab. TDS is deducted if annual interest exceeds ₹40,000 (₹50,000 for senior citizens).",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I withdraw my RD before maturity?",
      answer:
        "Yes, premature RD withdrawal is allowed but may attract a penalty. Also, interest is recalculated at a lower rate based on the actual holding period.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it possible to take a loan against an RD?",
      answer:
        "Yes, most banks allow loans up to 90% of the RD amount. The loan interest rate is slightly higher than the RD rate and is subject to bank terms.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is interest on RD calculated?",
      answer:
        "RD interest is calculated and compounded quarterly. It remains fixed throughout the tenure and is paid either monthly or at maturity, based on the scheme.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after an RD matures?",
      answer:
        "At maturity, the principal and interest are credited to your linked bank account. You can reinvest the amount or opt for automatic renewal, if offered by the bank.",
    },
