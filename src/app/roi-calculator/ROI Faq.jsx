        "ROI is a financial metric used to measure the profitability of an investment. It is expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing net profit by the cost of the investment.",

      question: "How is ROI calculated?",

        "ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) Ã— 100\n\nNet Profit = Final Value of Investment - Initial Cost.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is ROI important?",
      answer:
        "ROI helps investors compare the efficiency and profitability of different investments, making it easier to decide where to put money.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does ROI consider the time period of investment?",
      answer:
        "Basic ROI does not consider time. For time-adjusted performance, metrics like annualized ROI or CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) are used.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can ROI be negative?",
      answer: "Yes, a negative ROI indicates a loss on the investment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is ROI the only metric to evaluate investments?",
      answer:
        "No, ROI is simple but does not capture risk, time value of money, or cash flow timing. Other metrics like IRR, NPV, and payback period provide deeper insights.",
