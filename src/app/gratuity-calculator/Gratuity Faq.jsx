      question: "What is Gratuity?",
      answer:
        "Gratuity is a lump sum payment made by an employer to an employee as appreciation for their service when they leave the organization, typically at retirement, resignation, or death.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who is eligible for Gratuity?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "How is Gratuity calculated?",
      answer:
        "Gratuity = (Last drawn salary × Years of service × 15) / 30.\nHere, 15 represents days of gratuity per year, and 30 is the number of days in a month.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Gratuity taxable?",
      answer:
        "Gratuity is taxable but exemptions apply. Under the Payment of Gratuity Act, gratuity up to ₹20 lakh is tax-exempt, subject to conditions like tenure and amount received.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the maximum limit of Gratuity?",
      answer:

    {
      question: "When is Gratuity paid?",
      answer:
        "Gratuity is paid within 30 days after an employee leaves the company, whether due to retirement, resignation, or termination. In case of death or disability, it is paid to the nominee.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can an employee forfeit Gratuity?",
      answer:
        "Yes, gratuity can be forfeited if the employee is dismissed for misconduct or fraud, or fails to complete 5 years of service. It is not forfeited for voluntary resignation, illness, or death.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Gratuity be transferred between employers?",
      answer:
        "Yes, gratuity can be transferred if the employee switches jobs and has completed 5 years with the previous employer. The new employer facilitates the transfer upon request.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is Gratuity different from Provident Fund (PF)?",
      answer:
        "Gratuity is a one-time payment after 5 years of service, based on salary and tenure. PF is a retirement savings scheme with regular contributions from employer and employee, payable with interest upon retirement or resignation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Gratuity applicable to private sector employees?",
      answer:
        "Yes, private sector employees in organizations with 10 or more employees, who have 5 years of continuous service, are eligible under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.",
