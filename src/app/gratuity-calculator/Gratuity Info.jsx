          What is Gratuity?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>Gratuity</strong> is a form of financial benefit provided by
          an employer to an employee as a reward for long-term service. In
          India, it is governed by the{" "}
          <strong>Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972</strong>, which ensures that
          employees who have worked for an organization for a certain number of
          years are entitled to a lump sum payment once they leave the company,
          either due to retirement, resignation, or other reasons such as death
          or disability.

          How Gratuity is Calculated
        </h3>

        <p className="">
          The calculation of gratuity can vary depending on the laws in
          different countries, but the basic formula remains quite similar. In
          India, the formula typically involves the employee's last drawn
          salary, years of service, and a fixed multiplier.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-2 md:p-4 rounded-lg mt-4 shadow-md">
          <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-4">
            Gratuity Formula:
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-2 md:mb-4">
            Gratuity is calculated based on the following formula:
          </p>
          <code className="font-bold">
            Gratuity = (Last Drawn Salary × Years of Service × 15) / 26
          </code>
          <p className="mt-2">Where:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Last Drawn Salary</strong>: The salary the employee was
              drawing at the time of leaving the company, which includes basic
              salary and dearness allowance (DA).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Years of Service</strong>: The number of completed years
              of service with the organization.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mt-2">
            The constant multiplier (15/26) represents 15 days of wages for each
            completed year of service, calculated based on the standard number
            of working days in a month (26).
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="mt-4 mb-2">
          Let’s take example of Mr. Shyam has completed 10 years of service in
          the XYZ company. And, his last drawn salary along with dearness
          allowance (basic + DA) is ₹40,000.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2">The gratuity can be calculated as:</p>
        <code>
          Gratuity = (n × b × 15) / 26
          <br />
          Gratuity = (10 × 40,000 × 15) / 26
          <br />
          Gratuity = ₹2,30,769.23
        </code>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Based on this calculation, Mr. Shyam will receive a gratuity of{" "}
          ₹2,30,769.23. This gratuity amount is a one-time payment that he is
          entitled to as per his years of service and salary at the time of
          leaving the company.
