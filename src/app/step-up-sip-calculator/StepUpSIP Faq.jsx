      question: "What is a Step-Up SIP?",
      answer:
        "A Step-Up SIP (also called a Top-Up SIP) is a systematic investment plan where your SIP amount increases automatically at regular intervals—typically annually. It allows your investments to grow in line with your rising income.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is Step-Up SIP different from a regular SIP?",
      answer:
        "In a regular SIP, the investment amount stays fixed. A Step-Up SIP lets you increase your SIP amount periodically (e.g., by ₹500 or ₹1,000 every year), helping you build a larger corpus over time.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of Step-Up SIP?",
      answer:
        "- Investing more as your income grows\n- Better protection against inflation\n- Accelerated wealth creation through compounding\n- No need for manual increases",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I choose the Step-Up amount and frequency?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Most mutual fund platforms let you customize both the Step-Up amount (e.g., ₹500, ₹1,000) and frequency (annually or semi-annually), based on your financial goals.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I modify or stop the Step-Up SIP later?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You can pause, modify, or cancel the Step-Up option anytime via your mutual fund platform or directly with the Asset Management Company (AMC).",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Step-Up SIP good for long-term goals?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Step-Up SIPs are ideal for long-term financial goals like retirement planning, child’s education, or buying a home. They help you grow your investments steadily and effectively.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I start a Step-Up SIP?",
      answer:
        "You can start a Step-Up SIP via mutual fund apps, websites, or AMCs. Choose your fund, set the initial SIP amount, then select the Step-Up option with the desired increment and frequency.",
    },
