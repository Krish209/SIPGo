  },
  {
    question: "How does Compound Interest work?",
    answer:
      "Compound Interest adds earned interest to the principal, so future interest is calculated on a larger amount, accelerating growth compared to simple interest.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is compound interest used for?",

    question: "Can Compound Interest be negative?",
    answer:
      "While typically positive, compound interest can be negative in rare cases such as negative interest rate environments, causing the balance to shrink over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the advantages of Compound Interest?",
    answer:
      "1. Higher returns compared to simple interest.\n2. Greater impact over longer time periods.\n3. Increased growth with more frequent compounding.\n4. Effective for long-term wealth building.",
